### ml5 exercise

#### What is the goal of this exercise?

* We want you to learn somethings about ml5 and a different way of experimenting machine learning, a fun one, so we are providing you with the boring stuff..the handler functions...that you dont need to worry about , so you can focus on putting together the missing pieces of the code to make the models work

* Please keep in mind that there will be 5 exercises here, you may do distribute them as you like most, but we recommend one pull per exercise.

* Please note that for simplicity, we are going to be using the p5 online editor, otherwise we would have to build a node server to be able to run images in p5 and etc...Also , this way, the exercises will be better segmented!

* Note that, if you are unable to get to this editor or you dont want to use it for some reason, we got yor back, you can write the code and we will chek it to see if its correct!

* For image classification, you can find the pre-trained labels here: https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library/blob/development/src/utils/IMAGENET_CLASSES.js , use this to check if an existing item in there works correctly and also, to test a non existing thing there (there are 1000 elements present.)

1. Keep in mind that a pre-trained model doesnt have full accuracy but for reasons of complexity is what we are using in these examples. Instead, it has a finite number of elements it knows about. These models come from online so you will need internet access.

2. But , we encourage you to learn and do research about the models and whats behind them.

3. Please keep in mind that: The examples provided here use models that may take some seconds or longer depending on your computer , for them to load. And also, as mentioned earlier, these models come from the internet so that may also be a cause for it to go slowly.
